# Cross Validation
Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. It is a technique used to protect against overfitting in a predictive model, particularly in a case where the amount of data may be limited. In cross-validation, you make a fixed number of folds (or partitions) of the data, run the analysis on each fold, and then average the overall error estimate.

# Cross Validation Techniques

▪ Hold Out Cross Validation

▪ K-Fold Cross Validation

▪ Leave One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

▪ Stratified K Fold Cross Validation

# K-Folds Cross Validation

The general procedure is as follows:
1. Shuffle the dataset randomly.
   
2. Split the dataset into k groups
   
3. For each unique group:
  1. Take the group as a hold out or test data set
  2. Take the remaining groups as a training data set
  3. Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
  4. Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
     
4. Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores
